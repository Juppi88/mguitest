# Mylly GUI Test

Mylly GUI test is a unit test application for [Mylly GUI](https://github.com/teejii88/mgui) (MGUI). You can find more information about MGUI from the main repository page. This sample project builds a simple unit test separately for each reference renderer.

This repository includes MGUI and its support libraries as submodules, so clone the repository recursively. You'll need the latest beta version of [premake4](http://industriousone.com/premake/download) to generate the project files. Test skin and images for the unit test app can be found from [imgur](http://imgur.com/a/oOgzn).
